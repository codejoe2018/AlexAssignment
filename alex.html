             <h1>What are Terms & Conditions</h1>
             <p>Terms and Conditions are a set of rules and guidelines that a user must agree to in
                order to use your website or mobile app. It acts as a legal contract between you (the company)
                who has the website or mobile app and the user who access your website and mobile app.</p>
             <p>It is up to you to set the rules and guidelines that the user must agree to. You can think of 
                your Terms and Conditions agreement as the legal agreement where you <strong>maintain your rights</strong> to exclude
                users from your app in the event that they abuse your app, and where you maintain your legal rights
                against potential app abusers, and so on.</p>
             <img src="TCP.jpg" width="100%"/>
             <p>Terms and Conditions are also known as Terms of Service or Terms of Use.</p>
             <p>This type of legal agreement can be used for both your website and your mobile app. It is not required 
                (it is not recommended actually) to have separate Terms and Conditions agreements: one for your website and one for your mobile app.
                You can use this agreement anywhere, regardless what platform your business operates on:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Websites</li>
              <li>WordPress blogs or blogs on any kind of platform: Joomla!, Drupal etc.</li>
              <li>E-commerce shops</li>
              <li>Mobile apps: iOS, Android or Windows phone</li>
              <li>Desktop apps</li>
              <li><a href = "https://termsfeed.com/blog/terms-use-privacy-policy-saas-applications/">SaaS apps</a></li>
          </ul>
              <p>Desktop apps usually have the EULA agreement (End-User License Agreement) instead of a Terms and        Conditions agreement,
              but your business can use both. Mobile apps are increasingly using Terms and Conditions along with the EULA if the mobile 
              app has an online service component, i.e. it connects with a server.</p>

          <ol>
              <li>The <strong>Intellectual Property</strong> disclosure will inform users that the contents, logo and  other visual media you created
               is your property and is protected by copyright laws.</li>
              <li><strong>A Termination</strong> clause will inform that users accounts on your website and mobile app or users access to your website and mobile 
               (if users can't have an account with you) can be terminated in case of abuses or at your sole discretion.</li>
             <li><strong>A Governing Law</strong> will inform users which laws govern the agreement. This should the country in which your company is headquartered or the
             country from which you operate your website and mobile app.</li>
            <li>A<strong> Links To Other Web Sites</strong> clause will inform users that you are not responsible for any third party websites that you link to.
            This kind of clause will generally inform users that they are responsible for reading and agreeing (or disagreeing) with the Terms
            and Conditions or Privacy Policies of these third parties.</li>
